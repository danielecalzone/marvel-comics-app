# Marvel Comics App

This web application allows users to access information about Marvel's vast library of comics characters. Users can view a paginated list of characters and click on individual characters to see their details.

## Exercise

The Marvel Comics API allows developers everywhere to access information about Marvel's vast library of comicsâ€”from what's coming up, to 70 years ago. The goal of this exercise is to create a web application to get the list of the Marvel's comics characters and show the details when clicking one of them. It's up to you to decide what information will be displayed on the items list and on the details view, but the characters list must be a paginated list. Go to the [Marvel Developer Portal](https://developer.marvel.com/) and read the documentation before you get started. The Marvel Comics API is a RESTful service implementing an authorization mechanism based on API keys, so you will need to create an account to make the API calls.
